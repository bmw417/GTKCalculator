## SimpleCalc

SimpleCalc is a rudimentary calculator that is written in GTK3+. It supports floating point and 5 operators so far
(addition, subtration, multiplication, division, and exponents). This program will be updated in the future to support other operators and features along the way. 

TO INSTALL:
1. Clone repository or download the simpleCalc*.tar.gz archive and install.sh script into the same directory
2. Open a terminal and install the program with `sudo ./install.sh`
3. If you get a permission error on `sudo ./install.sh`, then run `chmod 755 install.sh && sudo ./install.sh`
4. You're done! Find the program by searching for it in a finder, or it can be found in the app tray depending on 
    your distribution. It can also be launched by running `simpleCalc` in the terminal.
    
TO UNINSTALL:
1. Clone repository or download uninstall.sh script
2. Run `sudo ./uninstall.sh` - if there's a permission error, run `chmod 755 uninstall.sh && sudo ./uninstall.sh`
